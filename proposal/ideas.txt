Ideas
=====

- Tapes are old & obsolete
- Hard drive storage is cheap & abundant
- Compression is therefore unnecessary
- Web interface for detailed control & reporting

Implementation
==============

- Send each file separately
- Store file mtime, mode, owner/group in database
- Use hardlinks to reduce storage requirements
- Only send changed files
- Remove stale database entries on backup completion

Backup Protocol
