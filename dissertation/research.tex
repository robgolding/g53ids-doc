\subsubsection{Amanda Network Backup}

AMANDA (Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver) is an open-source,
multi-platform network backup solution. It uses native Unix tools to archive
files (such as tar, dump etc.) to disk or tape on a central backup server.

\subsubsection{Dropbox}

Dropbox is primarily a file synchronization tool. It allows users to keep
a single directory tree synchronized between multiple computers (on different
platforms). The files are stored ``in the cloud'' on Dropbox's servers, and the
service is free for up to 2GB of storage. Basic version-control is available,
with a 30-day history allowed on the free plan.

\subsubsection{Ubuntu One}

Ubuntu One is essentially a clone of Dropbox, solely for Ubuntu users---though
a Windows client is currently in development---with a paid mobile service for
Android and iPhone devices. It is created and supported by Canonical, the
company behind the development of Ubuntu. Although Ubuntu itself is
open-source, Ubuntu one is a proprietary project. The ``agent'' that is
installed on the client is open, but the server-side code is not.

\subsubsection{Symantec Backup Exec}

Symantec Backup Exec (formerly VERITAS Backup Exec) is a more ``traditional''
network backup solution. It allows an administrator to backup multiple hosts to
a single tape unit or disk. The software has a long, proprietary history
starting with Maynard Electronics, and has recently added support for
continuous backup.

\subsubsection{Bacula}

Bacula is an open-source network backup solution, based around a modular
architecture comprising the \emph{Director}, the \emph{Storage Server}, the
\emph{File Server}, the \emph{Monitor} and the \emph{Console}. The project uses
a unique storage format, so backups cannot be restored without specially
written tools.
