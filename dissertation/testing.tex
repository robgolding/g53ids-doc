\chapter{Testing}

Django provides extensive support for testing through its \emph{testing
framework} and \emph{test client}, which were leveraged fully in this project.
Continuous Integration was used throughout the development process to ensure
a high level of software quality.

\section{Django Testing}

Django provides two main tools for thoroughly testing an application: the
testing framework and the test client.

The testing framework acts as a ``runner'', running all appropriate tests when
it is invoked and tracking the success or failure of each.

The test client is a simple HTTP client which can be used programmatically to
test the system from a user's perspective.

These two tools are used in conjunction to provide thorough testing for the
backup system.
