\section{Architecture}

The architecture of the system is similar to that of the open-source
\emph{Bacula} project, in that it is organised into separate modules. Figure
\ref{fig:architecture} shows the high-level layout of the design, with arrows
to represent the flow of data.

\end{figure}

At the centre of the system is the server daemon, \emph{backtracserverd}.  It
is this program that maintains a connection to the client daemon,
\emph{backtracd}, which is installed and running on each protected client.

The server daemon also has access to a database, which is used to store not
only the meta-data relating to files protected by the system, but also to the
hosts that it protects. This database is called the \emph{catalog}.

The \emph{storage} subsystem provides an interface for the server daemon to
read and write files to the physical disk, whilst not explicitly choosing their
location or name. This level of abstraction provides extensibility, should
a future implementation change be desired (for example, cloud storage).

The web interface (denoted as \emph{backtracweb} in figure
\ref{fig:architecture}) allows the administrator to manage and monitor all
aspects of the backup system. The application has read and write access to the
database so clients can be added or altered, and existing clients can be
inspected. Also, read-only access to the storage subsystem is permitted,
allowing the administrator to download files from the archive through the web
interface.

The server daemon and the web interface, though separate programs in their own
right, are intended to run on the same host---the \emph{backup server}.

The database, provided by an RDBMS such as MySQL or PostgreSQL (or SQLite for
smaller installations), can reside on host that is separate to the backup
server. For example, if an existing database server is already installed and
running at a particular site, that server may be used for storing the catalog.

\section{Catalog}

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \newlength{\svgwidth}
        \setlength{\svgwidth}{1.1\textwidth}
        \tiny
        \input{erd}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Entity-relationship diagram for the catalog database}
    \label{fig:erd}
\end{figure}

\subsection{File System Data}

The catalog provides the facility to store meta-data regarding the files that
are backed up. This meta-data includes the size of the file, when it was backed
up, the last modified time of the file, and a hash of the file's contents.

The relational model, depicted in figure \ref{fig:erd}, allows a tree structure
to be constructed, mirroring the structure of the filesystem on each client.

An \verb!Item! is a file or folder, which has a name and an optional parent
attribute. The parent attribute links an item to it's container (i.e. the
directory it is contained within). If no parent is present, then the item is
located in the root directory of the client

A number of \verb!Version!s can be associated with each \verb!Item!. Each of
these represents a version of the related file on the client, which has been
protected and is stored in the archive. A version has a unique identifier,
which can be used to retrieve the associated file from the storage subsystem.

\subsection{Other Data}
\label{sec:design-catalog-other}

Information relating to the clients themselves is stored in the same database
as the catalog, though it is strictly not considered part of the catalog
itself. A \verb!Client! represents a backup client, which has a hostname and
a secret key with which it authenticates itself to the server.

A separate \verb!Status! object is used to record whether the client is
connected or not, to avoid the user overwriting a status-update whilst
modifying a client through the web interface (as status updates happen whenever
the client connects or disconnects from the server). Each client has one (and
only one) status, so a one-to-one relationship is used here.

Each directory that is to be protected on a client is stored separately in the
database represented by a \verb!FilePath! object. Though it may seem
unnecessary to use an entire object for storing a single attribute, this
ensures that the database is properly normalized.

In the same way, patterns which define files that are to be excluded from the
backup on a given client are stored using \verb!Exclusion! objects.

A \verb!RestoreJob! represents the restoration of a specific version of a file,
to a particular client. It also has attributes to record when the restore was
created, started, and completed. Using these attributes, we can determine
whether the restore is pending, in progress, or completed.

Events relating to the backup file system are also stored in the database,
which are related to a particular \verb!Item!. The \verb!Event! object has
attributes to store when the event occurred, and the type of event
(\verb!created!, \verb!updated!, \verb!deleted! or \verb!restored!). These
event types represent the four distinct operations that can occur on a file
system item.

Finally, a \verb!GlobalExclusion! represents a global exclusion pattern, which
applies to all clients in the system. It is therefore not related to any other
entities in the database.

Figure \ref{fig:erd} shows the entity-relationship diagram for the catalog
database.

\section{Storage}
\label{sec:design-storage}

The storage subsystem provides a purposefully restricted interface for the
server to archive and retrieve files on the filesystem. A file in the storage
subsystem is identified by three attributes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Bucket name
    \item File name
    \item Version ID
\end{itemize}

To archive a file, only the bucket name and file name must be specified. The
storage subsystem will then generate a unique version ID for the incoming file.
The file will then be written to the archive, in a location which allows it to
be accessed later given these three attributes.

To retrieve a file, the bucket name, file name \emph{and} the version ID must
be specified. The storage subsystem will then retrieve the file, and allow
access to it in a \emph{read-only} manner---as files which have already been
archived should not be modified under any circumstances.

The storage subsystem gives the server code a way of storing files and their
associated versions, without needing to decide (or indeed, record) where on the
filesystem they are located. The server simply needs to record the three
attributes which are used to retrieve a particular file from the archive.

This approach has been chosen as it not only simplifies and abstracts access to
the file system, but also provides a way of structuring the archive, and
keeping that structure intact.

    \caption{Structure of the storage archive on the backup server}
    \label{fig:archive-structure}
\end{figure}

The three attributes (bucket name, file name, and version ID) have been chosen
to fit the three pieces of information that are required to identify a file on
a given client in the system---the client's hostname, the file path, and the
version of the file. Figure \ref{fig:archive-structure} shows the structure of
the archive on the file system.

As the figure shows, the top-level directories (buckets) contain all files for
a particular client. Within each bucket, a folder is created for each file on
that client. This folder holds every version of that file, named according to
it's unique ID. This allows a particular version of a file on a specified
client to be retrieved quickly and easily.

\section{Server}

With a focus on extensibility, the server---like the system itself---is
designed to be modular. The server is depicted is \emph{backtracserverd} in
figure \ref{fig:architecture}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \setlength{\unitlength}{0.14in}

        \put(10,17.5){\vector(-1,0){4}}
        \put(22,16){\framebox(6,4){Client}}
    \end{picture}
    \caption{Diagram showing the structure of the backup server}
    \label{fig:server}
\end{figure}

The core daemon handles the network communication to
and from the client application, archiving files to the file system using the
aforementioned storage subsystem.

Also, the server does not have direct access to the catalog database. Instead,
access is provided through an API. This means that changes in the structure of
the database need not affect the server, simplifying future development.

Figure \ref{fig:server} shows the structure of the server, and how it interacts
with the rest of the system.

\subsection{Client}

As with the server---to provide maximum extensibility---the client is designed
to be modular in nature. The client is depicted is \emph{backtracd} in figure
\ref{fig:architecture}.


\begin{figure}[h]
    \setlength{\unitlength}{0.14in}
    \centering
    \footnotesize
    \begin{picture}(28,15)
        \put(10,0){\framebox(8,4){Backup Queue}}

        \put(22,0){\framebox(8,4){FS Monitor}}
        \put(13.5,4){\vector(0,1){4}}
        \put(14.5,8){\vector(0,-1){4}}
        \put(10,8){\framebox(8,4){Core Daemon}}
        \put(18,10.5){\vector(1,0){4}}
        \put(22,9.5){\vector(-1,0){4}}
        \put(0,8){\framebox(6,4){Server}}
        \put(6,10.5){\vector(1,0){4}}
        \put(10,9.5){\vector(-1,0){4}}
        \put(22,8){\framebox(8,4){Transfer Queue}}
    \end{picture}
    \caption{Diagram showing the structure of the backup client}
    \label{fig:client}
\end{figure}

Again, the core daemon handles the network communication to and from the server
application. This communication, however, is governed by two queues: the
\emph{backup queue} and the \emph{transfer queue}. The queues are required
because of the nature of the client application---providing a bridge between
the (very fast) file system, and the (relatively slow) network.

The backup queue is a queue of items to be queried with the server (to
determine if a backup of that item is required or not). If a backup is
required, the item is moved to the transfer queue. If not, then no action is
taken.

The transfer queue is a queue of items waiting to be archived to the server.

Items can be added to the backup queue in a two ways: the startup scan, and via
the file system monitor.

\subsubsection{Startup Scan}

When the client application is first started, it contacts the server to
retrieve the list of directories it should protect. These are ``scanned'' by
adding every file within each protected directory to the backup queue. The
server will then be queried as to whether a backup of each file is required,
and if so it will be added to the transfer queue.

\subsubsection{File System Monitor}

Once the startup scan is complete, the file system monitor takes over. Watching
for events occurring within protected directories, it places items on the queue
when a file is created, modified or deleted.

\subsection{Web Interface}

The web interface is designed with usability in mind, and with the
consideration that its purpose is to allow access to the data in the system
quickly and easily. The interface elements are therefore simple and clean, and
their meaning is clear.

\subsubsection{Header}

The header, which remains consistent throughout the entire interface, shows the
product logo and name along with the user's authentication details. This also
offers a link for the user to leave the system from any screen via the
``logout'' button. Figure \ref{fig:backtrac-header} shows a screenshot of the
header.

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{backtrac-header}
    \end{center}
    \caption{A screenshot of the header, which is shown atop every page}
    \label{fig:backtrac-header}
\end{figure}

The main navigation system is tab-based, with the current tab highlighted to
clearly show where the user is at any one point in time.

\subsubsection{Dashboard}
\label{sec:implementation-web-dashboard}

The dashboard provides a high-level system overview, giving the administrator
access to the most important information in one place. Figure
\ref{fig:backtrac-dashboard} shows a screenshot of the dashboard page.

The dashboard summarizes the following information:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The utilization of the backup filesystem (i.e. the filesystem which
        the archive is stored on)
    \item The total amount of data protected by the backup system
    \item A graph showing the total amount of protected data over time
    \item The status of the backup server itself (i.e. whether it is running)
    \item A list of recent events
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{backtrac-dashboard}
    \end{center}
    \caption{A screenshot of the dashboard page}
    \label{fig:backtrac-dashboard}
\end{figure}

Much of the information is shown in a visual format (i.e. a bar showing the
disk utilization and a graph showing historical data) so that it can be
interpreted as quickly as possible by the user. This is important to to ensure
that the web interface performs its purpose well---to provide quick and easy
access to \emph{data}.

\subsubsection{Clients}
\label{sec:implementation-web-clients}

The clients interface allows the administrator to add, edit or delete backup
clients. When a client is added, it is configured with a secret key and a list
of paths to backup. Figure \ref{fig:backtrac-clients-add} shows a screenshot of
the form used when adding a client.

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{backtrac-clients-add}
    \end{center}
    \caption{A screenshot of the add client form}
    \label{fig:backtrac-clients-add}
\end{figure}

Note that backup paths can be added quickly and easily, as can exclusions.
These fields can be added or removed dynamically by clicking on the ``add
another'' button, or the remove button next to the relevant field. All
icon-only elements contain alternative text so that they can still be read if
the images are unavailable, or if a screen reader is in use (for the visually
impaired, for example).

\subsubsection{Browse}
\label{sec:implementation-web-browse}

The administrator can browse the catalog of protected items through the web
interface, using the ``browse'' tab. The ``drill-down'' method is used to
provide a familiar way of traversing the filesystem once a client has been
chosen.

When browsing the catalog, the administrator can choose to show or hide deleted
files. This preference is retained throughout the session whilst browsing the
catalog for the same client---to save clicking the same button over and over.
A screenshot of the browsing interface is shown in figure
\ref{fig:backtrac-browse}.

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{backtrac-browse}
    \end{center}
    \caption{A screenshot of the catalog browsing interface}
    \label{fig:backtrac-browse}
\end{figure}

Once a file has been selected, a detailed screen shows the different versions
of that file and their respective modification times and sizes. The
administrator can then choose to view one of the versions in the browser (in
the case of a plain text file, image or PDF document), download it, or restore
it to a chosen client. The selected version can be restored to the client from
which it originated, or any other client in the system. Also, it can either be
restored to its original location or another chosen path.

A screenshot of the detailed file view is shown in figure
\ref{fig:backtrac-file-detail}. As shown in the figure, a graph showing the
size of the file over time is also included on the file detail page---showing
how the file has evolved since it was first created.

\begin{figure}

        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{backtrac-file-detail}
    \end{center}
    \caption{A screenshot of the detailed file view}
    \label{fig:backtrac-file-detail}
\end{figure}

\section{Methodology}

The design described in this section is the result of multiple prototypes,
which eventually evolved into the final system. In the early stages of the
project, initial prototypes were also used to produce a coherent specification
containing the detail required to implement and test the final iteration of the
software itself. These prototypes were used to gather feedback from the
project's industrial sponsor, \emph{Servat, Ltd.}, and to refine the technical
design.

Initially, a fully web-based design was chosen, due to the author's experience
with web technologies. Based on this design, a prototype was developed which
provided a rich RESTful API via the web interface, through which the backup
clients would interact with the server. This essentially removes the need for
a backup server, simplifying the architecture somewhat.

This simplified architecture, however, quickly proved to be unsuitable for the
purpose in hand, due to the overhead incurred when using HTTP, and was revised.
The next prototype used the Twisted framework for communication, which proved
to be extremely powerful and much more suited to the job. The architecture of
this prototype eventually evolved into the final design described by this
document.

A detailed discussion of the methodology used in this project is included in
section \ref{sec:implementation-methodology}.
