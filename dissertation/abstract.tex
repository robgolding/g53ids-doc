In recent years, the landscape of backup systems has been shifting
dramatically. The massive amount of storage space now available on cheap,
reliable hard disks has led to an upsurge in so-called ``cloud'' backup
providers, who offer to protect your data at a minuscule cost. These providers
can even afford to store every version of a file, as storage space is so cheap.

Meanwhile, however, traditional backup systems which run on internal company
servers have not been following the same trend. Many of these systems still
backup to magnetic tapes, missing the benefits of large, available storage
provided by modern hard disk technology.

For this project, an open-source system is developed to do just that.
\emph{Backtrac Backup System} provides version control for servers and
workstations on a network, allowing individual files to be restored quickly and
easily through an easy-to-use web interface.

Industrial support is gained from a small accounting systems provider,
\emph{Servat, Ltd}, who also resell a remote backup system to their customers.

Ultimately, the software fulfilled all the requirements detailed in the
specification, and proved to be an effective method of protecting data. Given
multi-platform support and data encryption, Servat would consider the product
ready for use in a commercial setting.
