\section{Overview}

\emph{Backtrac Backup System} is an open-source backup system for small to
medium-sized installations, which focuses on version control for individual
files. The system is comprised of two main components: the \emph{server} (of
which there is one per installation), and the \emph{client} (of which there
may be many).

The clients are the computers which contain important data, to be
protected by the system. This data is transferred over the network, and stored
on the server.

\section{Scenarios}

 - Some user scenarios would be nice. Include *far* too much detail. -

\section{Non Goals}

The system (at least this particular version) will \emph{not} provide the
following features:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Bare-metal disaster recovery for entire operating systems
    \item Cloud support for off-site data storage (e.g. Amazon S3)
\end{itemize}
