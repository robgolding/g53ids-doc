\chapter{Specification}

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) was produced with the backing of
\textbf{Servat Ltd.}, of Nottingham.

Servat is primarily an accounting system provider, installing and maintaining
software such as DataFile, Aquilla and SAP for their clients. They also resell
a remote backup service to their customers, based on the \emph{Vembu StoreGrid}
system. This puts the company in an ideal position to offer advice for this
project.

\section{Overview}

\emph{Backtrac Backup System} is an open-source backup system for small to
medium-sized installations, which focuses on version control for individual
files. The system is comprised of two main components: the \emph{server} (of
which there is one per installation), and the \emph{client} (of which there
may be many).

The clients are the computers which contain important data, to be
protected by the system. This data is transferred over the network, and stored
on the server.

The administrator can access the backups via a web interface, which allows
him or her to browse the files that have been archived for all protected
clients.

\section{System Context}

The system will have only minimal interaction with other systems, and all
aspects of the system itself will be self-contained. A dedicated database of
user authentication information will be stored, meaning that external factors
do not affect the ability of the administrator(s) to access backups.

It is envisaged that the backup server will run on a dedicated hardware
machine, with plentiful storage (ideally in a RAID configuration, to guard
against disk failures).

\section{Non Goals}

The system (at least this particular version) will \emph{not} provide the
following features:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Bare-metal disaster recovery for entire operating systems
    \item Cloud support for off-site data storage (e.g. Amazon S3)
\end{itemize}
