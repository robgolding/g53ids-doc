\label{chap:further-work}

This project has great scope for expanding into multiple areas of research,
some of which were considered for inclusion. Some of those possible areas for
expansion are detailed in this section, with discussion as to how they might be
realised given what has been achieved thus far.

\section{Cloud Services}

``The cloud'' is becoming a very hot topic, both in research and in people's
every day lives. For further security, the backup system could potentially
replicate the archive to a cloud storage provider---mitigating the effect of
a complete hardware failure or even a natural disaster.

From another point of view, the backup system could compete against other cloud
providers such as Mozy and Carbonite, offering a totally online service.

Both of these points are entirely possibly given the extensible architecture of
the backup system. Firstly, an alternative storage subsystem could be written
to leverage cloud services such as Amazon S3, providing the same interface as
the existing one. The two subsystems could then be swapped, or even run
simultaneously, giving the desired result.

    \item Data de-duplication
    \item Diffing
\end{itemize}
