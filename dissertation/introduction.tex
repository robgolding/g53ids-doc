\section{Introduction}

It is a well-known fact that computers (or more specifically hard drives) do
not last forever. When these parts fail, it can be a very expensive and
time-consuming process to recover the data that was stored on them - not to
mention the cost of operating without said data until it is recovered (that is
if it \emph{can} be recovered). In fact, in the US alone, data loss is
estimated to cost businesses \$18.2 billion annually\cite{smith03}. Therefore,
keeping backups of important or valuable data is an essential part of
maintaining a computer system or network.

There are two main approaches to backing up a file system: physical and
logical\cite{hutchinson99}. Physical file system backups duplicate the physical
medium upon which the data resides. This is analogous to the Unix ``dd''
command, and requires that the backup image be ``mounted'' before individual
files can be extracted. This method is a good fit for disaster recovery
scenarios (when an entire server has failed, for example), but not so for
accidentally deleted or overridden files.

Logical file system backups, however, aim to interpret the file system meta
data, in order to discover which files need to be duplicated.  In contrast to
the physical method, logical file system backups make the process of restoring
individual files and folders very simple, though they do not lend themselves so
easily to ``bare-metal'' restores.

Of course, backups are worth nothing if the data they contain cannot be
restored.
