\chapter{Evaluation}

The software produced in this project has met every requirement set out in the
specification. The end result is deemed to be a significant step towards
a viable offering by \emph{Servat, Ltd} of Nottingham, who agreed to support
this project in the initial stages and have provided a detailed evaluation.

    At Servat, we are mainly an accounting systems provider, installing and
    maintaining DataFile for our clients. We also resell a remote backup
    system, however, called Vembu. This is re-branded as our own product,
    DataSquirrel. DataSquirrel backs up customer data over the internet to
    a server in the cloud.

    The software Rob has produced is of a standard we would consider marketing
    as an in-house alternative to our DataSquirrel product. There are, however,
    a number of things which prevent us from doing so.
    
    Firstly, the backup system does not support Windows operating systems,
    which is a definite must in our customer environments, which are almost
    entirely Windows-based. Also, the backups themselves are not encrypted,
    which, when dealing with sensitive accounting data, would also be required.
    Finally, the installation process is somewhat complex, and would not be
    suitable for distribution to customers as-is. This would need to be refined
    before the software could be realistically used in a commercial setting.

    Aside from these issues, the software is generally well produced and
    professional. It fulfils every requirement in the specification which was
    written at the beginning of the project, and performs well in all areas. In
    particular, the web interface is well designed and intuitive, which would
    allow less technical personnel to recover files without contacting us
    unnecessarily. All-in-all, an impressive piece of work!
