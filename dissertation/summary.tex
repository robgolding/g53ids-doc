\section{Summary}

The ultimate goal of this project---to produce a working backup system based on
the principles of version control and ease-of-use---was achieved. The software
delivers in all aspects which were promised, providing:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Version-based backup and recovery,
    \item A web interface for central management,
    \item Detailed reports in the form of events and catalog browsing,
    \item Instant file recovery via the web interface.
\end{itemize}

Given that the core project aims outlined in section
\ref{sec:introduction-aims} have been achieved, the project can be deemed to
have been a success.

On the road to project completion, the intermediate objectives must also be
considered. Expertise has been gained in the use and workings of the
technologies involved, multiple prototypes have been produced and an industrial
sponsor's support gained.

In summary, the backup system does everything it is supposed to do, whilst
leaving room for improvement and development upon the foundation that has been
laid.

\subsection{Personal Reflections}

From the outset, this project was to be an ambitious attempt to produce
a highly critical piece of software, upon which people depend when others fail.

Having previous experience developing web applications, the author's first
instincts to create an entirely web-based system turned out to be entirely
incompatible. As a result, the project was re-written multiple times, finally
achieving an acceptable result.

Certainly the most challenging aspect of this project was working with the
\emph{Twisted} framework. By all accounts, Twisted is an amazingly powerful
piece of software. Apparently, however, the developers have little time left
after creating such a marvel---as the documentation is severely lacking. After
hacking workarounds for numerous bugs, guessing at API parameters, and
unpicking countless lines of code, the author's endeavours have certainly paid
off.

Though, as always is the case with such things, a far superior and more novel
product could have been achieved given just \emph{a little more time}, the
author feels a sense of achievement in creating a system which punches well
above its weight in offering that which others do not: \emph{simple},
\emph{intuitive} and best of all \emph{free} version control for your backups!

\section{Further Work}
\label{sec:summary-further}

This project has great scope for expanding into multiple areas of research,
some of which were considered for inclusion. Some of those possible areas for
expansion are detailed in this section, with discussion as to how they might be
realised given what has been achieved thus far.

\subsection{Cloud Services}

``The cloud'' is becoming a very hot topic, both in research and in people's
every day lives. For further security, the backup system could potentially
replicate the archive to a cloud storage provider---mitigating the effect of
a complete hardware failure or even a natural disaster.

From another point of view, the backup system could compete against other cloud
providers such as Mozy and Carbonite, offering a totally online service.

Both of these points are entirely possibly given the extensible architecture of
the backup system. Firstly, an alternative storage subsystem could be written
to leverage cloud services such as Amazon S3, providing the same interface as
the existing one. The two subsystems could then be swapped, or even run
simultaneously, giving the desired result.

\subsection{Peer-to-Peer Backups}

The increasing size of hard disks, along with the falling cost of such storage
media has led to an interesting phenomenon: large amounts of wasted space. In
fact, a 1999 study which analyzed 4801 Windows computers in a commercial
environment found that, on average, file systems were only 53\% full
\cite{douceur1999}. Bearing in mind that this study is, at the time of writing,
over 10 years old, it is fairly safe to assume that this figure is now even less.

Given the collective sum of all this wasted disk space, a backup system which
replicated files to multiple workstations rather than a single server could
prove to be very effective. Not only could a greater resilience to failure be
achieved by replicating data over multiple systems rather that just one, but
also a significant cost saving could be made by avoiding need to purchase
a large amount of dedicated storage.

The current system architecture could be augmented to implement a peer-to-peer
system by utilising the backup server as a ``command and control'' node,
choosing which distributed nodes to place archived files and recording their
location in a database. Though the architecture differs greatly from that which
is used at present, the foundations have been laid making this type of
development possible in the future.

\subsection{Data Deduplication}

Data deduplication is a technique which identifies and eliminates redundant
information, thereby reducing the size of a data volume \cite{geer2008}. The
concept of data deduplication has been around since the 1960s, though recent
advances in technology have seen modern systems developed which are far more
sophisticated than early attempts.

Usually, a hashing function is used to compare files (or parts of files, called
\emph{blocks}), and determine whether they are identical. If so, only one copy
of the data is stored, which may be referenced by multiple separate files or
blocks. In this way, redundant data is eliminated, saving storage space.

Given the modular nature of the system developed in this project, a file-based
data deduplication solution could be implemented which builds on the
functionality of the storage subsystem described in section
\ref{sec:implementation-server-storage}. A block-level solution, however, would
require much more effort---perhaps developing a custom file system built for
the purpose.

\subsection{Diffing}

Diffing is a process which calculates the changes that have occurred in a file
since the last time it was archived, and only transfers the changed data. This
has the advantage of saving significant network bandwidth, especially when
applied to large files which only change by small amounts.

As the backup system stands, files such as system logs---which change by small
amounts relatively often---are transferred in full every time they are
modified. With a diffing process, however, only the changes are transferred
each time. These changes can then be applied to the file on the server to
recreate the modified file, achieving the same result whilst using far less
network resources.
